101963,Terbinafine,"Onychomycosis, Toenail","""After a much needed pedicure, I noticed my big toe was starting to look sort of discolored/grayish at the cuticle. A few months passed and it became worse. The toenail thickened and became flaky. I would sometimes experience excruciating pain and a throbbing sensation in my toe along with a reddened outer area. My physician prescribed Terbinafine after an initial liver function test. This test was repeated 1 month after treatment, three months after that, and since my results have been fine, he has ordered no more repeats. I am about to start my 5th month (out of 6) and am already seeing great results. It's a slow process (he said it could take a year) but my new nail is coming in great!""",9,4-Sep-15,8,positive

176373,Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I suffer from PTSD, depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. I previously took Xanax, but it was too short acting for me. I needed a benzodiazepine that was longer acting, since my anxiety goes on for a long time. I like that Ativan lasts 6-8 hours, in which I need for times of long time anxiousness. However I have realized that smoking cigarettes lessens the effectiveness of benzodiazepines, so I will have to work around that. Anyway, Ativan is great for people like me who have anxiety and panic attacks.""",9,28-Apr-15,106,positive

She said Tri Sprintec is the generic for Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo and works similarly to your natural body's hormone process. Since I started it each month my skin has gotten clearer and the PMS mood swings before my period are getting better. I was definitely more moody after I started taking this birth control. The biggest thing I've noticed is lack of sexual drive but my skins clear, little weight gain, and no hair loss. So I'm sticking with it. """,10,7-Jan-14,14,positive

My doctor recommended it because I randomly began to have a very abnormal menstural cycle and the cramps became excruciating. Almost as soon as I started NR, I began to have spurts of VERY sharp pains all throughout the day. They were so bad that sometimes I would find myself hunched over. My doctor and I assumed my body was just adjusting to the NR. These pains went on for about a month and then everything ceased. From that point on everything as far as pain, and the regulation of my menstural cycle was fine. I really loved the convenience of NR. I stopped using NR in Dec 2016.

Pros thus far: no breast tenderness (they did increase in size), no acne (skin actually cleared up), no weight gain (I'm very active to begin with), no nausea or headaches, much lighter periods (prior to the pill, my periods were heavy enough where both a pad and a tampon were needed... Now a tampon alone is good enough!)
Cons: ever since starting it, I've been having two periods a month.. 15 day cycle and it's about two days longer than period prior to taking this pill. The pros definitely outweigh the con, but I can't stand having two periods a month!""",7,21-Sep-13,17,neutral

All I want to do All day is sleep. I've told my doctor but he keeps telling me to give it some more time....... I have kids I have to take care of, but I feel so tired and lazy on seroquel. Only upside is it does help me sleep throughout then night instead of being awake depressing about my life.

This medicine helped me to regain back my focus and general improvement to mood as well. Despite the nausea that still persists 3 months into taking the medicine, this is something i wouldnt mind since it did help me to cope with my depression.

At first the treatment was a little drying so I went to using it every other night and now I am applying it every night following it up with the moisturizer. My skin is DEFINITELY clearer.

Once put on generic in March 2016, I began having intense migraines 3-4 times a week, as well as extreme fatigue. I thought it was a side effect of a bad upper respiratory infection I'd had a month prior so I did not seek medical attention.



After two months of being on this pill with the intense migraines and fatigue, I had a minor stroke and was hospitalized for days.

I had to lay there while she removed my Nexplanon (I was switching from Nexplanon to Skyla.) And afterwards, it took me awhile to even get up.

It is super convenient, no pregnancies and if you're forgetful like I am it works GREAT! I tried the pill and that made me very nauseous so I decided to give Ortho Evra a try and it was the best decision I've ever made! My breasts grew but that's about the only side effect I experienced. Unfortunately I've been getting a lot of yeast infections recently so I'm going to try the Nuvaring to see if the Ortho patch is what's causing it (highly doubtful). Worth a try though. I highly recommend Ortho Evra.""",9,26-Dec-13,31,positive
188379,ParaGard,Birth Control,"""I absolutely love my ParaGard IUD choice.  It has been the best choice for me in terms of birth control as hormonal birth control was not something that I wanted to be on any longer.  I did not find insertion painful, more like a heavy period cramp that lasted 10-20 seconds.  I had light cramping with my periods prior to the IUD insertion and my cramping has not changed significantly at all.  My cycle is slightly longer. The first few months were tender and I did have some increased cramping initially but it returned to my normal within a few months.  I also experienced a pH change in the first few months resulting in a vaginal infection.  This went away after my body adjusted to the IUD.  Since then, it has been such a great choice!""",10,23-May-17,8,positive
